      How to learn programming
      <img class="founder-letter-box-right" src="@/asset/images/box2.png" alt=""></div>
    <div class="founder-letter-content">
      <p>Recently I am thinking how my kid is going to learn programming when he is a bit older. Surly it depends on his interest. But as a programmer of 30 years and as I am generally interested and conerned with education, I looked into the current youth programming situation. So I played teachergaming in details, tynker.com, google classroom in additional to dozens of similar platforms and games.</p>
      <p>The current platforms for teaching kids programming are quite wrong to me, I would rather my kid to play good games than to learn programming on these platforms. So how can a professional programmer like me teach his/her own children programming? This is the problem I want to solve with our software and lessons. Here I want to offer an autobiography of my psersonal life journey of programming since age 7.I started programming since age 7. There are a few key points from my own experiences, which I hope to bring to all kids around the world as if I was always by their sides.</p>

        In 1989 when I was 7, my father took me to his lab and gave me a book which I could not understand, but after I typed-in (copied) with keyboard like 20 lines of code from the book into the IBM PC, I saw a beautiful animated image appearing on screen. My father explained the meaning of some commands in language that I could almost understand. “Code is amazing!” and I realized in my little brain that I could do a lot more with it in the future.

        <div class="founder-letter-content-takeaway-label">Core takeaway:</div><br>
        Kids do not begin programming with writing or solving puzzles, they see and read first and imitate like a pro-programmer without the need to understand all the code they typed. This is how kids learn to speak their own native language: they see and read 100 times more than they write, this is true in how they learn their native languages as well.

        A year later I got my own IBM PC at home. My father downloaded quite a few PC games and saved first in floppy disks and later in a CD. In the following 3 years, I played many (300+) games and learned DOS commands to install and run some big games. The game designer in late 1980s and early 1990s put really great brainpower in designing their games. I still believe games that kids play in 2010s are no match to those early games I mastered. I have been collecting good indi-games when I grew up, but as technology evolves, I have seen less and less good games each year (graphics are getting better; games are more addictive with levels and multi-player mode, most of today’s games keep users on a fast pace decision-making trail than let them think slowly and contemplate deeply). When I was around 12 years old, I gradually stopped playing the games, instead I had developed skills that I believed I could create 90% of the games that I played, and I spent lots of time writing and debugging my own games.</p>
      <div class="founder-letter-content-takeaway">
        <div class="founder-letter-content-takeaway-label">Core takeaway:</div><br>
        Playing lots of good games is very important to let the kids know what they want to build themselves when they grow up. Kids who only play a few games will not have any ideas of what projects they want to build. Instead, kids needs to play as many games as possible and be really good at them.

        In my early years, I played all games on IBM PC with a keyboard and later a mouse. Many of my peers played only on specialized game gadgets, they can only became good gamers but never programmers, because they did not have keyboards and they did not manually install games with commands to make them run in 640KB memory like I did. BTW, my peers who played on Apple PC do not become programmers either. Although when my friend showed me the first Mac latop, I thought it was cool, but I still liked my 80386 running windows 3.1 then.</p>
      <div class="founder-letter-content-takeaway">
        <div class="founder-letter-content-takeaway-label">Core takeaway:</div><br>
        Introduce kids to playing on PC as early as possible. Teach them typing with a keyboard and a mouse. Choose the right operating system (prefer Windows, MAC is fine today, but not back then)!

        I used QuickBasic/C under DOS first, later Microsoft released their first IDE: version 1 of visual basic and c++, and I immediately switched to it, because the first version of Windows and the IDE can build graphical windows apps. Throughout my early years of programming, I grew up with their IDE. It is still today’s most popular IDE. However, elementary schools back then only teach QuickBasic in DOS, students in my school do not become young programmers like me.</p>
      <div class="founder-letter-content-takeaway">
        <div class="founder-letter-content-takeaway-label">Core takeaway:</div><br>
        Kids should program with the right tool and language that enable them to program for the next 10 years rather than simple throw-away code that only imitates coding. Do not make the kids keep switching IDE/apps. Instead, gradually give them tools that all work together, which can be used in the professional environment.

        Did I mention that I have a computer teacher that reviewed my code every weekend for 10 years, since I was 8? Yes, this is the most important part in my early project based learning. In my first 19 years, I lived on university campus of HIT (the one who built China’s first computer and robotics lab). And I had a computer teacher Mr. Lu Yang who was 12 years older than me and also lived and studied on the same university campus. He is a computer genius to me.</p>
      <div class="founder-letter-content-takeaway">
        <div class="founder-letter-content-takeaway-label">Core takeaway:</div><br>
        In project based learning, it is important that each kid has a mentor who is at least 12 years older than the kid but learned with the kids and helped review code and provide guidance. This teacher had better to be a university student like in my case. Adults learn faster than kids and can provide essential help.

        When Internet was not born yet, my bookshelf had all the computer books that I could buy. Microsoft released its windows NT preview API via MSDN subscription (two very thick books) between 1990 and 1992. My teacher got one and gave it to me after he finished reading, he also recommended one or two other thick books to me too, of which I read over a hundred of times. In the early days, I spent lots of time reading books, like the printed API reference manual and the help pages of MSDN. I learned English mostly for reading these docs. I also remembered two books that magically appeared in my bookshelf, one contains 100 computer game design docs WITHOUT implementation but has some code hints; the other one contains 300 design doc of scientific home-made inventions. I implemented lots of them in software and in the physical world when I was 10-12 years old, later I was able to design my own games and spent more time in the software world. In 1995, we had Internet, web portals and CDROM all of a sudden, it opened a new world. In 1997, I finished one network based game that I worked on since 1995, and later some games in 3D, and then I created my own website and open sourced all my 20 games on it. (In early days, I lost source code many times due to computer failures and cried). Since the middle school, my projects are pretty big ones and school work was heavy, and I only released one or two projects per year, but I spent all my free time in programming.</p>

        <div class="founder-letter-content-takeaway-label">Core takeaway:</div><br>
        How and from where kids obtain information are very important. The kids should soon move on to obtain information from the real world such as the official dev site, search engines and books written by real masters for pro-programmers. Parents and teachers should provide guidance directing kids to those information source. They do not need to understand all of them, but in my experience, kids have the ability to figure them out and leave placeholders in their brain. This is true when a new baby is born into such a complex world and forced to live in it without enough knowledge, but all of them survive without a problem.

        It is really lucky that I can grow with the developers of the tools I used and read all their change logs. I witnessed the complete evolution of windows and visual studio. I knew all the new functions, technologies, new languages, user interface changes between each of their releases since version 1. The users of Haqi witnessed the same 4 year evolution of paracraft, this is why many of our fans are old users since the initial release.</p>

        If we can not live with Socrates together, we can always simulate him. This is why we created paracraft and wrote books and tutorials to simulate the evolution of great thoughts and complex software. Nowadays, kids have huge selection of big games and mature tools. Unlike my childhood, they can easily get lost and it is hard for them to focus on learning programming. We should prepare and create projects or games that are simple and easy to play with and break up, letting them see internals and make changes. So the kids can learn with a smooth learning curve and grow with it for years.

      <p>Conclusions:<br>
        Programming is becoming increasing important in today’s world. It is the literacy of this modern world, it also helps us gain deep insight of our world. We melt the above key points in our making of paracraft and its various 3D projects or works so kids can grow their digital skills naturally inside paracraft. By the age of 15, some of them can work like a pro-programmer if they have immersed themselves continuously in paracraft. This is our vision and our ongoing work, and here I share with the world what it is, hoping together we can give our kids a better way to learn programming.</p>
